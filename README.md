# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends in fundraising efforts from various categories and countries.  
In this case, we want to provide guidance to help raise funds for a new play in the US and possibly a musical in England.

In the accompanying Excel file, you will find two helpful sheets: 

"Descriptive Statistics" will show that the $10,000 goal is not impossible. Although that amount is above the average of successful campaigns, it is not out of reach.

The "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" sheet will show that the best bet is to launch the Kickstarter campaign on June 1.

There is missing data that would be helpful: do the successful campaigns include 'angel investors' or 'anchor gifts'? And if so, how early in the campaign were they secured?
When Launching a campaign on June 1, it would be helpful to have a few significant gifts secured at the onset.
